# flow-synth

A modular digital audio workstation for synthesis/sequencing/live coding/visuals/etc.

## This project is on hiatus while I'm busy with school. It's also at a very early stage. It is currently not useful for anything. APIs and use cases can/will change tremendously.

Documentation is currently hosted on the [wiki](/../../wiki).

Development follows nightly Rust. To test it out, do

`$ rustup run nightly cargo run --release`

If you get errors, it's probably either because your rustc is out of date, or because I haven't updated the project yet after some breaking change. Grabbing the nightly at the time of the most recent commit should resolve the issue.
